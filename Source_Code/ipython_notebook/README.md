Developed by Lingkun Kong, including the details of CNN network training.

## Dependencies
- [python2.7](http://python.org)
- [openCV3](http://opencv.org/)
- [caffe](https://github.com/BVLC/caffe)(here we will give configure file)
- [matlab r2016b](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html)
- [Anaconda2.7](https://www.continuum.io/downloads)
- [ipython notebook](try to use conda install)

## Usage

First of all, you should configure the caffe. We strongly recommend you to use Ubuntu 14.04 system as it can avoid many bugs. And the configure document is in the caffe_config file, you should carefully read it and set the right path.

Then, you should input ipython notebook under the home path. And you can now open the saliency.ipynb and fuse.ipynb document. In fact on it, you can clearly see a lot of comment and details about how to operate it.
Be careful to check the path of the trainng weights or the loaded image.

## Something else
In fact, configure caffe is not a easy thing to do. Even you have already configured it on your computer or server, it still have chance doesn't work because of some annoying bugs.

So if you have any problems, you can email me at kenny_kong@foxmail.com, I can help to solve your problem.

Or if you just don't want to waste time configuring enviroment, just email me! And you can use teamviewer to operate the code on my remote computer!!
