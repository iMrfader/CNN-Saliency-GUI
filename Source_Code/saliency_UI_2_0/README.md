Developed by Lingkun Kong, including the GUI of the final project of CG class.

## introduction
This GUI presents the input and the output of saliency results.

## Dependencies
- [python3.x](http://python.org)(important! python 2.7 doesn't work)
- [Anaconda3.5](http://anaconda.org)(There are a lot library need to be installed, so we highly recommend you to install anaconda)

## Usage

cd into the current file;
python main.py;
open the picture in picture file to test the data;
close the image!;
click start;
click result to see final result;

The important thing is that if you want operate the button you have to close the image first.

## Something else
In fact, this GUI just helps to illustrate how saliency prediction works, and it actually just shows the data preprocessed by saliency.ipynb. So if you want to see more details of CNN network or our visualization models, you might run the saliency.ipynb and fuse.ipynb under the caffe + python2.7 + anaconda2.7
